  - Merge - The pull request is added to the base branch in a merge commit.
  - Rebase - Commits from the pull request are added onto the base branch individually without a merge commit.
  - Squash - The pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit before they are merged to the base branch.

{-| Convert from a String representation to an elm representation enum.
This is the inverse of the Enum `toString` function. So you can call `toString` and then convert back `fromString` safely.

    Swapi.Enum.Episode.NewHope

        |> Swapi.Enum.Episode.fromString

This can be useful for generating Strings to use for <select> menus to check which item was selected.
